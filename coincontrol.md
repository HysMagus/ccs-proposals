**Proposal**

Our plan is to review the current implementation of coin control on QT, and replicate it in the Client, while having our UI specialist work in tandem to create a series of sexy frontend elements for the client version of coin control.

The majority of time will be spent porting functionality from coin control in QT to the Vue JS Client 

The payout breakdown would be a 45% initial payment, followed by a 30% payout upon the release of a initial testable version and a 25% final payout upon the acceptance and completion of the project. 

The estimated timeframe on this project would be approximately two calendar weeks, which is 1 calendar (2 week) sprints.

The team breakdown for this engagement would be:

- 1 Full Time Developer 
- 1 UI/UX Specialist (.5 Sprint)
- 1 Project Manager
